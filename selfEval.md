# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I feel that I did not struggle very much in this topic, I had 1 small challenge in object.js (line 105) at the very end I did not completely understand that it was asking so I reached out to my partner today (Sam) and he helped to clarify what was being asked. Besides that I felt confident while completing this work.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
I am a good note taker, one thing that I am going to add and change is to physically write down all of the code I have typed into my notebook so I can better manage my open tabs and also so I can refer back to lessons and see specific examples of code and label what each piece means/ does.

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I do my best to apply what I learned from the examples provided in the reading first to challenge my understanding. Normally I have noticed that I will mostly look at my own past examples/ code to try and solve my new problems first. It is clear to me when I am unproductively struggling and when that is the case I will turn to see if Google can get me back on track.
